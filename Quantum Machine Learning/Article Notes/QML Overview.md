# Quantum Machine Learning (QML)

**_Intersection of Quantum Computing and Artificial Intelligence._**

Essentials of creating quantum algorithms for AI models, their practical use cases on open source platforms, and best practices for implementing these advanced algorithms.

**_QML - Combines the principles of quantum computing with ML Algos to create models that can process and analyse large datasets more efficiently than classical computers._**

The inherent parallelism and entanglement properties of quantum computing enable it to perform complex computations at unprecendented speeds. 
This capability is particularly benefical in the context of machine learning, where large scale data processing and model training are often bottlenecks.

Companies like IBM, Google and Microsoft have developed quantum processors and platforms that are accessible to researchers and developers. 
These platforms provide the necessary tools to design, test and deploy quantum algorithms for various applications, including AI models. 


QML could solve problems such as Optimising large datasets, enhacing pattern recognition and improving predictive models. 



# Reference architecuture for quantum machine learning solutions

Desiging an effective QML solution requires a well thought out architecture that leverages both quantum and classical resources. 

A typical reference architecture of QML involves several key components:

## Quantum Processing Unit (QPU):
QPU - Perform Quantum Computations.

Companies like IBM and D-Wave offer cloud-based access to their QPUs, allowing developers to run quantum algos without needing their own quantum hardware.

## Classical Computing Resources:
- In addition to the QPU, classical computing resources are essential for pre-processing data, managing quantum circuits, and post-processing the results. 
- High Perf classical computers often work in tandem with QPUs to handle these tasks efficiently.

## Hybrid algorithms:
- QML often employs hybrid algorithms that _**combine quantum and classical techniques**_. 
- For example, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) use quantum circuits to perform specific parts of the computation, while classical algorithms optimise the overall process.

## Data Management:
- Efficient data management systems are crucial for **_handling the large volumes of data typically involved in machine learning tasks_**. 
- These systems must support the _**seamless transfer of data between classical and quantum systems**_.

## Development Environment:
- A Development environment such as **_IBM's Qiskit_** or **_Google's Cirq_**, provides the necessary tools and libraries for developing and testing quantum algorithms.
- These environments often include simulators, debuggers, and visualisation tools to aid developers in their work.
